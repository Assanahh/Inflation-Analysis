Analyzing the impacts of inflation on the Nigerian economy: A data-driven approach  

 # Insight and Recommendation

 # Introduction
 
One key macroeconomic indicator that has far-reaching ripple effects and affects the everyday life of Nigerians is inflation. Over the past decade, Nigeria has experienced an exponential rise in inflation, pushing more than half of its population below the poverty line. This report examines the causes of inflation and its impact on people and the economy. Using historical data, I analyzed inflation’s relationship with key indicators such as monetary policy, exchange rates, unemployment rates, and the prices of goods. Leveraging Power BI’s powerful visualizations, I explored trends and components of these variables. The goal of this analysis is to identify different types of inflation, highlight inflationary trends over the past decade, and examine how different economic factors contribute to fluctuations in inflation.

**Food Inflation vs Headline Inflation**: On a year-on-year basis in 2010, Food inflation rate stood at 14.77% relative to Headline inflation rate of the same year at 13.88%. Looking at the movement, food inflation showed a slight increase of 0.89% compared to the headline inflation. Meanwhile, in 2024, Food and Headline Inflation jumped to significant leap of 38.91% and 32.8% respectively. The rise represents an unprecedented level of inflation in both categories, showing an all-time high rate recorded in the history of the country.
Monthly and Annual Inflation Trends: Headline Inflation rate on a Month-on-Month and Year-on-Year basis move together rapidly, indicating a steeper upward trend on the graph. On both occasions, inflation surged more than twice their previous levels in the span of ten years (2010 - 2024).
Headline Inflation Rate and Purchasing Power: A strong negative correlation exists between inflation and purchasing power. Using 2009’s CPI of 100 as the baseline for comparison, our analysis reveals a steep decline in the purchasing power of Naira. As inflation rate grows increasingly, purchasing power falls dramatically. In reference to 2009, with a CPI baseline of 100, the purchasing power of Naira declined to just 14% by 2024. This implies that an item that cost N100 in 2009 would now cost approximately N714 in 2024, meaning the same amount of money buys significantly less today. This indicates that inflation has significantly eroded the value of our money.

**Exchange Rate and Headline Inflation Rate:** The USD to NGN exchange rate surged to an alarming average of ₦1,477 in 2024, up from ₦148.8 in 2010.  As Naira depreciates sharply against the strong Dollar, inflation rate skyrocketed, growing over twofold. Our analysis reveals a sharp deterioration in the Naira’s value, indicating a positive correlation between inflation and exchange rates. Notably, in 2009 (our baseline), the CPI was 100, whereas by 2024, inflation had risen by 32.8%, bringing the average CPI to 696. Over ten years, the price level became more than six times higher than in 2009.

**CBN Monetary Policy Rate and Inflation Rate**: The MPR is the official interest rate of the CBN, which anchors all other interest rates in the money market and the economy. When the CBN adjusts interest rates, it influences the exchange rate, which in turn indirectly impacts the general price level of goods and services. On a year-on-year basis, Inflation rate tends to increase or decrease gradually following shifts in interest rates. From 2018 to 2019, interest rate fell by 2.9% where a drop of 5.7% was recorded for inflation between both years. Interest rate made a big leap in 2024, reaching an all-time high rate of 24.39. As a result, inflation followed sharply, climbing to 32.8%.

Food & Non Alcoholic Bev.	                                    16.98
Housing Water, Electricity. Gas and Other Fuel	               5.48

Health                                                         0.98
Miscellaneous Goods & Services	                               0.55
Restaurant & Hotels	                                           0.4

Recreation & Culture  	                                       0.23
Communication	                                                 0.22

At 16.98%, Food (& Non Alcoholic Bev.) inflation is the biggest contributor to All item index, also known as headline inflation. The rise in headline inflation on a year-on-year basis was largely caused by increases in the prices of food items.
